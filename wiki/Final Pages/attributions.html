  <p style="font-family:avenir;font-size:18px;">
  It is thanks to the support of New York University Abu Dhabi and beyond that Volatect was able to come to life. The team was able to push the boundaries of science and engineering through the help and dedication of the core team of students in collaboration with faculty, researchers and field specialists.
  Volatect’s advances in the realm of producing self-contained and reliable point-of-care (POC) is something we are extremely proud to share just as we are delighted to showcase the multifaceted and interdisciplinary collaborations that made our research and development dreams come to life.
<br/><br/>
<h4 style="font-family:avenir;">  Dr. Yong Rafael Song </h4><br/>
  Associate Professor of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering<br/><br/>
  Dr. Song was our main Principal Investigator (PI). He helped narrow down the focus and provided us with the proper tools to test the microfluidics setups. Being a world-renounced expert in microfluidics, his publications like “Enhancing the speed of morpholino-DNA biosensor by electrokinetic concentration of DNA in a microfluidic chip” and “Rapid Detection and Trapping of Extracellular Vesicles by Electrokinetic Concentration for Liquid Biopsy on Chip” were a guiding light in the early stages of deciding on what direction to go with our goal to improve last year’s microfluidics chip resolution. <br/>

  Furthermore, Dr. Song’s early on instructions made the use of microfluidics a natural conclusion to our literature review on current integrated diagnostic technologies rather than just an axiomatic endeavor to improve last year’s results. We were provided with 3M films and were suggested production protocols which were later optimized by the engineering team regarding the use of cheap materials and new innovative combinations that optimized flow without compromising on geometric versatility.
<br/><br/>

  <h4 style="font-family:avenir;">Dr. Alan Healy </h4><br/><br/>

  Assistant Professor of Chemistry

  Since the early ideation phases, Dr.Healy helped the team explore many options regarding disease prevention and contagion. Through his insights we considered antibiotic resistance and respective devices under development and were thus aware of the vast amount of research required to assess the milestones achieved and what is still needed. “A simple and cheap field assay for antibiotic combinations would be an important development.”<br/><br/>

  In addition to his support during the brainstorming of which idea to go with, Dr. Healy gave inspiring feedback regarding the simulation of disease contagion using the geographical diversity of the iGEM student researcher’s home country. <br/>


  <h4 style="font-family:avenir;">Dr. Mazin Magzoub</h4>
  Assistant Professor of Practice in Biology<br/><br/>

  Dr. Mazin provided us with useful feedback regarding the pathogen selection process and on the device features that would seem elegant and useful at the same time. Through Dr. Mazin’s feedback, the student’s team was able to use the appropriate nucleic acid amplifaction techniques. <br/>

  Dr. Mazin’s help with the presentation was also essential to the proper delivery of Volatect’s working principles, scientific rigor and engineered ingenuity. <br/>

  <h4 style="font-family:avenir;">Mr. Ibrahim Chehade </h4>
  Associate Instructor<br/><br/>

  Mr. Chehade was actively involved in the ideation and lab work since the early phase of the research. Through his technical knowledge of biology protocols and amplification the team was able to design a scalable detection protocol. Mr Chehade’s undergraduate teaching experience ensured that being on the forefront of life sciences was not overwhelming and that the new concepts and procedures were thoroughly understood by every member of the team. This process also ensured a very constructive communication regarding physical requirements between the engineering and biology teams. <br/>

  Mr. Chehade helped with the preparation of DNA cleavage assays, fluorophore quenchers and DETECTR assays. Through his support the biology team was able to get meaningful results using RPA and replicating the previous year’s LAMP protocols. Another important contribution would certainly be the continuous advice regarding order of kits and reagents and the preparation of bio-bricks. <br/>

  <h4 style="font-family:avenir;">Dr. Andras Gyorgy </h4>

  Dr. Gyorgy helped steered un towards airport disease security. He also provided useful feedback during the through literature review made by the team and PIs when choosing the target groups and pathogens. Dr.Gyorgy helped the engineering team find and obtain an effective light source of industrial fidelity to obtain fluorescence at the desired wavelength based on the Stokes Shift. <br/>

  <h4 style="font-family:avenir;">Mr. Ashley Isaac</h4>

  Mr. Isaac helped the team with experimental protocols and various advice regarding the inner workings of the specific lab procedures. <br/>

  <h4 style="font-family:avenir;">Mr. Esteban Salvemini</h4>

  Mr. Salvemini helped the engineering team follow stricter and empirically constructive research and development protocols. He helped the engineering team with the patent research and literature review, both tasks that ended up shaping the prototyping phases. <br/>

  Mr. Salvemini trained everyone on the principles and hard skills of Laser Cutting, basic tool functionalities and other additive and subtractive techniques like 3D printing, molding and milling respectively. Giving the engineering team access to the Advanced Manufacturing Workshop made the development of the heating device and microfluidics chip very efficient. His observations during the work and both in person and remote consulting helped the team work safely surrounded by high-fidelity industrial equipment and produce industry-worthy prototype by generating value through rigorous experimentation and manufacturing. <br/>

  Mr. Salvemini provided invaluable help when designing possible valves to prevent backflow and when designing the circuits for the heating device. He connected us with Dr. Zoltán Derzsi who suggested Peltier elements as temperature control device through current flow and PCB heaters as a possible replacement with lower energy requirements. Dr. Derzsi also provided advice regarding the use of MOSFETS (The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) instead of normal junction transistors that use current. Dr. Derzsi also guided the team with choosing the best type of phototransistors, improve detection accuracy and ensure good interfacing between the microcontroller and Raspberry Pi. <br/>

  <u><h2 style="font-family:avenir;">INSTITUTIONS</h2></u>

  Johannes Kepler University<br/>
  Institute for Integrated Circuits<br/>

  Andreas Grimmer, Philipp Frank, Philipp Ebner, Sebastian Häfner, Andreas Richter and Robert Wille’s paper “Meander Designer: Automatically Generating Meander Channel Design” led us to the meander design tool developed by them. <br/>

  After some minor technical obstacles with the tool, Robert Wille provided the engineering team with feedback and support. It was through their tool and the inspiration from Boston University’s 2017 project MARS that we were able to implement meanders in our innovative fully 3M® film produced chip. Although the design moved away from meanders due to other complexities, it was the help from Prof. Wille and their volume-based meander design tool that generated a scaled vector graphics file which in turn helped the engineering team pump small amounts to the scale of microliters. Having reliable meander designs which we later fully changed and implemented into the prototype helped us explore various geometry layouts  and settle with the most optimal one. <br/>
